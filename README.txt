Running with elevated privileges on Mac OS X
============================================

As the name suggests, this tool is able to launch other programs with elevated
privileges on Mac OS X. Darwin is probably missing such a tool (a.k.a graphical
sudo).

Running it is straightforward, just append the executable path and its arguments
on the command-line.

Compiling
=========

1. Get XCode
2. Open the project
3. Build using the "Release" target
4. Enjoy either as a standalone tool, or embedded as an external tool for your own applications.
